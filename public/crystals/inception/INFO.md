# THE NETWORK IN NETWORK

**Year:** 2014
**Architecture:** GoogleNet (Inception-v1)
**Shape:** The Lattice
**Concept:** Width & Branching

While VGG went deeper, Inception went wider.
It introduced the "Inception Module": running multiple convolutions (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) in parallel and concatenating the results.

The crystal visualizes this **Branching Complexity**. Instead of a simple tower, the lattice handles multiple spatial frequencies simultaneously.
