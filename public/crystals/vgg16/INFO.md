# THE DEEP TOWER

**Architecture:** VGG-16
**Shape:** The Monolith
**Concept:** Uniformity

VGG (2014) represents the era of "Just Add More Layers."
Before VGG, architectures were messy. VGG standardized everything: 3x3 convolutions, stacked on top of each other.

The crystal is a massive, solid tower. It represents the brute force approach that dominated vision before ResNet's skip connections made infinite depth possible.
