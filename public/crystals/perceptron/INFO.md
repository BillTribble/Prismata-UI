# THE ATOM of AI

**Year:** 1958
**Architecture:** Perceptron
**Shape:** The Plane
**Concept:** Linear Separability

The single neuron. The grandparent of all Deep Learning.
Designed by Frank Rosenblatt, the Mark I Perceptron was a physical machine intended to model the human brain.

The crystal is a single, flat plane. It represents the limit of linear computing (Input x Weight + Bias). It cannot solve XOR, but it started the dream of Artificial Intelligence.
